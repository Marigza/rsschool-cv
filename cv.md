## About myself
My work experience has taught me how to interact with a team, work with large amounts of information and separate the main from the secondary.

After moving to another city, there was a desire to try myself in other areas of activity. I came to programming after communication and recommendations from friends and acquaintances. This area contains a lot of new, constantly changing information, which allows the neural connections in the head to work. 

My purpose is to learn and grow into a top-grade frontend developer.
## Skills
* GIT
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
## Code example
``` JavaScript

    const isPensioner = (age) => age >= 60;

## Experience
I have a little experience in development. In march 2023 I has successfully graduated pre-school stage at RS-School. Previously, I worked as an accountant (cash desk, bank, suppliers, contractors, salaries, taxes, fixed assets) and a tax inspector (desk audits of the correctness of VAT calculations).
